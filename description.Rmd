This talk will serve as an introduction to what RStudio can offer for those that do not use it, as well as a showcase for more advanced use for those who use it only for scripting purposes.

Topics include:

- Scripting shortcuts
- Customization
- Using Projects
- Document generation
- Interactive Visualization
- Addins
- Package Development
- Debugging and Profiling
- Version Control

Note that this is not a hands-on workshop, just a demonstration of what is possible within the RStudio environment.  However, attendees are encouraged to bring a laptop to try some things out as we go along, and get assistance afterward.
