## 

<div style='text-align: center; font-size:32'><h1>Projects<h1></div>


## Projects

<span class="emph">Projects</span> provide a self-contained ecosystem within which to work.

- Projects have their their own working directory, workspace, etc.

If you have multiple projects, you can easily jump between them.

- Without losing your place


## Projects

File/New Project

<div style='text-align:center;'><img src="img/project1.png", style="width: 50%;"/></div>

Usually you'll select new, but you'll want to note the other options.

- We'll talk about version control later.


## Projects

All tabs opened will remain open when you revisit the project.

You can have multiple projects running at the same time

- i.e. multiple RStudio instances

Projects can be seen as a first step in getting more organized, more reproducible etc.
