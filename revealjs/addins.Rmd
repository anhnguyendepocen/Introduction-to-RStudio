<div style='text-align: center; font-size:32'><h1>Addins<h1></div>


## Addins

RStudio allows its users to create functions that can be used within RStudio with a click or keystroke.

These special functions are called <span class="emph">addins</span>.

Addins are a great way to increase your productivity and efficiency when scripting.

They can be anything, but the easiest (and perhaps most useful) example is text insertion/formatting.

- Saves a lot of time in document creation


## Creating Addins

Addins are nothing more than R functions that you can call interactively.

```{r}
likeR = function() {
  rstudioapi::insertText("I like R!")
}
```

```
likeR()
I like R!
```

## Example: ColorPicker

<img src="../img/colorpicker.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; width: 50%">
