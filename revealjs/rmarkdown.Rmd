## What is R?

R is fast becoming a general programming environment rather than just a statistical one.

<span class="emph">Markdown</span> is a language that allows for easier web-based documentation.

- Not necessary to know html

Now one can intermingle R with markdown, <span class="emph">html</span>, <span class="emph">css</span>, <span class="emph">JavaScript</span>, <span class="emph">$\</span>LaTeX$ and others resulting in a variety of products


## Rmarkdown

- html, pdf, doc
- presentations (like this one)
- dashboards
- notebooks
- websites
- other publication


## Example

File/New/R Markdown...

Or many of the others too.

R <span class="emph">chunks</span> are interspersed throughout the Rmd file, combining code, plain text, markdown and possibly others.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print("This is an R chunk, in a slide, of the presentation you're looking at!")
```

<div style='text-align: center;'><img src="../img/rchunk.png", style="width:85%"/></div>



## Rmarkdown

Once your file is ready, <span class="emph">knit</span> the document into the format your want.

- Ctrl/Cmd-Shft-K

An Rmarkdown workshop will be given in the future for more details.
