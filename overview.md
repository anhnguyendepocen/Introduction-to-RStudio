Base R is an extremely powerful tool

The syntax editor in Base R is awful

You should use something more efficient and easy to use

Options:

- Rstudio
- Emacs
- Vim
- Various others


Overview
========================================================
Rstudio's strength is in assuming an interactive session from the outset

Emacs is especially powerful and useful

- Some of the R-core maintain Emacs Speaks Statistics

However, there is an Emacs (and Vim) mode within Rstudio

- Bring that editing approach to Rstudio with you

You still might want it for documents/presentation

- $\LaTeX$ isn't everything
