## Projects

Projects provide a self-contained ecosystem within which to work.

- Projects have their their own working directory, workspace, etc.

If you have multiple projects, you can easily jump between them.

- Without losing your place


## Projects

File/New Project

<img src="img/project1.png", width="50%", height="50%">

Usually you'll select new, but you'll want to note the other options.

- We'll talk about version control later.
