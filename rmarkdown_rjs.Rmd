## What is R?

R is fast becoming a general programming environment rather than just a statistical one.

Markdown is a language that allows for easier web-based documentation.

- Not necessary to know html

Now one can intermingle R with markdown, html, css, javascript, $\LaTeX$ and others resulting in a variety of products


## Rmarkdown

- html, pdf, doc
- presentations (like this one)
- dashboards
- notebooks
- websites
- other publication


## Example

File/New/R Markdown...

Or many of the others too.

R 'chunks' are interspersed throughout the Rmd file, combining code, plain text, markdown and possibly others.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print("This is an R chunk, in a slide, of the presentation you're looking at!")
```

<div style='text-align: center;'><img src="img/rchunk.png", style="width:85%"/></div>

An Rmarkdown workshop will be given in the future for more details.
