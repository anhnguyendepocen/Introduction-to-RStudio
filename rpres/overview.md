Base R is an extremely powerful tool

The syntax editor in Base R is awful

You should use something more efficient and easy to use

Options:

- Rstudio
- Emacs
- Vim
- Various others



Overview
========================================================
Rstudio's strength is in assuming an interactive session from the outset

Emacs is especially powerful and useful (though at its core, a text editor rather than IDE)

- Some of the R-core maintain Emacs Speaks Statistics

However, there is an Emacs (and Vim) mode within Rstudio

- Bring that editing approach to Rstudio with you

You still might want RStudio for documents/presentation

- $\LaTeX$ isn't everything

    -Spell check

- Web publishing

- Interactive visualization
- Addins


Overview
========================================================
Rstudio is an excellent tool for reproducible research

- Project management
- Package building and freezing
- Document generation

In short, you can go from data import to (modern, web-based) publication and replication
