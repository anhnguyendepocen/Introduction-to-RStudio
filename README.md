# Introduction-to-RStudio

Workshop to help people to use RStudio for more than scripting. Unfortunately many don't even use RStudio for scripting efficiently, plus they miss out on all the other fun stuff. This presentation is an attempt to present what all RStudio has to offer. [link to presentation](http://m-clark.github.io/docs/introRstudio.html)
