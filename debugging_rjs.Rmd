## What is Debugging?


Debugging is merely finding and fixing problematic code.

  - Code will always have bugs

Debugging is an absolutely essential part of creating functions.

## A note about functions

If you are doing anything more than twice, you should write a function instead.

- It's more generalizable
- It's more reproducible
- Debugging can allow one to spot issues
- RStudio can help you get started transforming existing code to a function

    - Ctrl+Alt+X on highlighted code


## Debugging in RStudio

There are numerous facilities within R to help you debug your code.

- Break Points

- <span class="func">browser()</span>

- <span class="func">debugonce()</span>


RStudio makes the process easier.


## Overview


Break Points

- used to enter into debugging at a certain line

<span class="func">browser()</span>

- Used to stop a function at a certain point and enter into debugging.

<span class="func">debug()</span> <span class="func">debugonce()</span>

- Enter debugging on next function call



## Debug Mode Commands


There are commands that allow you to work through debugging:

- Next (n): runs the next line

- Step into (s): if the next line is a new function, it enters into the function

  - Careful with this one; you can get pretty far into other functions

- Finish (f): finishes the function

- Continue `(c)`: stops debugging and runs the function

- Stop (Q): stops debugging and does not run the function

Each of these also has a button in the debugging menu

## Profiling

## Quick Wrap

>- Debugging is an important part of programming.

>- RStudio makes the debugging more interactive and flexible than R alone.
