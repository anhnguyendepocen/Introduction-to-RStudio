# Debugging {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}


## Overview


### What is Debugging?

Debugging is merely finding and fixing problematic code.

  - Code will always have bugs

Debugging is an absolutely essential part of creating functions.

Debugging in RStudio

There are numerous facilities within R to help you debug your code.

As with everything, RStudio makes the whole process easier.

 - RStudio also has numerous facilities for debugging.

### Break Points

<span class="func">browser()</span>

<span class="func">debugonce()</span>


Editor breakpoints are used to enter into debugging at a certain line.

Breakpoints are created by clicking next to a line number in a function.

You must <span class="func">source()</span> the function before the breakpoints will be implemented



### Debug Mode Commands


There are commands that allow you to work through debugging:

- Next (n): runs the next line

- Step into (s): if the next line is a new function, it enters into the function

  - Careful with this one; you can get pretty far into other functions

- Finish (f): finishes the function

- Continue `(c)`: stops debugging and runs the function

- Stop (Q): stops debugging and does not run the function

Each of these also has a button in the debugging menu

### Quick Wrap


Debugging is an important part of programming.

RStudio makes the debugging more interactive and flexible than R alone.



## Details



### browser()

Used to stop a function at a certain point and enter into debugging.

  - Essentially a hard-coded editor breakpoint

```{r browserExample, eval=FALSE, out.width=9}
wackyAvg = function(a, b, c, d, e, f) {
  resSum = (a * .5) + (b * 2.5) + (c * 4.5) + (d * 6.5) + (e * 8.5) + (f * 10.5)
  browser()
  wackAvg = resSum / 6
  print(wackAvg)
}
```

### debug() and debugonce()


As opposed to specifying breakpoints or including a <span class="func">browser()</span> line, <span class="func">debug()</span> will start from the top and work through each line.

The <span class="func">debug()</span> function will run everytime you run the function.

  - You will have to <span class="func">undebug()</span> to break this behavior

Using <span class="func">debugonce()</span> will keep that loop from starting.


### debug()


```{r debugExample, eval=FALSE}
wackyAvg = function(a, b, c, d, e, f) {
  resSum = (a * .5) + (b * 2.5) + (c * 4.5) + (d * 6.5) + (e * 8.5) + (f * 10.5)
  wackAvg = resSum / 6
  print(wackAvg)
}

debug(wackyAvg)

wackyAvg(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

undebug(wackyAvg)
```


### debugonce()


```{r debugonceExample, eval=FALSE}
wackyAvg = function(a, b, c, d, e, f) {
  resSum = (a * .5) + (b * 2.5) + (c * 4.5) + (d * 6.5) + (e * 8.5) + (f * 10.5)
  wackAvg = resSum / 6
  print(wackAvg)
}

debugonce(wackyAvg)

wackyAvg(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
```
