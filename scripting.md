Scripting
========================================================

Everyone uses Rstudio for easier scripting

- Syntax highlighting
- Autocomplete of object/function names, etc.
- Autopairing of parenthesis, quotes etc.
- Auto indent

It even makes working at the console viable

- Still not advised


Must-use Keyboard shortcuts: standard scripts
========================================================
Run current line: Ctrl+Entr

Run up to/from current line: Ctrl+Alt+B/Ctrl+Alt+E

Run everything: Ctrl+Shft+Entr



Must-use Keyboard shortcuts: standard scripts
========================================================
Copy up/down: Ctrl+Shft+up/down

Move up/down: Shft+up/down

Snippets
========================================================

Snippets allow one to insert code of a certain form for certain commonly used functions.

- For loops, apply family, etc.

You only have to type the first couple letters, the form of the rest of the code will fill out, then you can tab your way through the rest of it.


```r
name <- function(variables) {

}

for (variable in vector) {

}

apply(array, margin, ...)
```
